//START ROUTE 1

    /* 
        server route for handling GET requests from the GivingTool.js page. On this page, the request occurs whenever the user toggles
        a folder tab and when this occurs, the userId and selectedYear values are sent in the url. This route will recive the url params
        and use them to construct a SQL query to the database which SELECTS all rows in the gift_items table WHERE user_id == UserId
        AND date == selectedYear. The returned rows then need to be parse into an object in the form below, and the gift object is sent 
        back to the client.

        Example Gift Record:
            {
            type: "One-off",
            organisation: "Salvation Army",
            amount: 50,
            date: "23/05/2025",
            description: "Red shield appeal",
            receipt: "{url_path}"
            }
    */

        //extract query strings
        const userId = req.query.UserId; 
        const year = req.query.Year;
        


    });

//START ROUTE 2

    /* 
        route for handling GET requests from the useEffect in GivingTool.js which runs when the page renders, and requests
        an object in the following form which contains an array of DGR organisations
